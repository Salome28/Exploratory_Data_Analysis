# Exploratory Data Analysis 

## Introduction 

For my initial exploratory data analysis (EDA), I chose to thoroughly examine Olympic data across centuries, aiming to visually represent the evolutionary changes in the world of sports throughout history.

### Assumptions 

Before exploring any dataset, it's essential to make note of your assumptions. In the case of the Olympics, I had various assumptions, such as which gender predominantly won medals and which countries accumulated the most medals. This is why I chose to focus my EDA on these particular topics.
